How to start
============

Create file ~/.aws/credentials for Linux or MacOS or C:\Users\USERNAME\.aws\credentials for Windows with the following content:

```js
[default]
aws_access_key_id = <FEED_ME>
aws_secret_access_key = <FEED_ME>
```

For Windows:

1. Run `mkdir .aws`
2. Run `copy con credentials`, then type `Ctrl+Z`

Put instead of <FEED_ME> proper content.
